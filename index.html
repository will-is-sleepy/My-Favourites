    <h2 class="purple">Krakow, Poland</h2>
    <p>
      Krakow is a beautiful city in Poland with lots of cultural history and
      many landmarks to visit. It is one of my favourite places to visit due to
      the amount of family I have there and the architecture is very pretty.

    <h2 class="porple">Theatre and Improv</h2>

    <p>
      These are two of my favourite extracurriculars. I spend majority of my
      time in the theatre. During tech week it's alot of work putting a show
      together and it can get quite stressful but the payout of watching the
      show become a success is worth it. When I'm not working as a techie in the
      theatre then I'm doing improv with my friends here at Ainlay.

    <h2 class="blue">Poetry</h2>

    <p>
      I love to write and poetry is just a good way for my to channel my
      emotions. It's a way of putting my feelings on paper and to just express
      creativity. A few years ago I did some polish spoken word poetry
      competitions and usually made it in the top 3.
    </p>
    <p>Some some different types of poetry are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Free verse</li>
      <li>Haiku</li>
      <li>Sonnet</li>
      <li>Acrostic</li>
      <li>Limerick</li>
      <li>Ode</li>
      <li>Ballad</li>
    </ul>
